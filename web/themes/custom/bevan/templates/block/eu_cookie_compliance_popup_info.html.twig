 * This is a template file for a banner prompting user to give their consent for
 * the website to set cookies.
 *
 * When overriding this template it is important to note that jQuery will use
 * the following classes to assign actions to buttons:
 *
 * agree-button      - agree to setting cookies
 * find-more-button  - link to an information page
 *
 * Variables available:
 * - message:  Contains the text that will be display whithin the banner
 * - agree_button: Label for the primary/agree button. Note that this is the
 *   primary button. For backwards compatibility, the name remains agree_button.
 * - disagree_button: Contains Cookie policy button title. (Note: for historical
 *   reasons, this label is called "disagree" even though it just displays the
 *   privacy policy.)
 * - secondary_button_label: Contains the secondary button label. The current
 *   action depends on whether you're running the module in Opt-out or Opt-in
 *   mode.
 * - primary_button_class: Contains class names for the primary button.
 * - secondary_button_class: Contains class names for the secondary button
 *   (if visible).
 * - cookie_categories: Contains a array with cookie categories that can be
 *   agreed or disagreed to separately.
 * - save_preferences_button_label: Label text for a button to save the consent
 *   preferences.
 * - fix_first_cookie_category: Boolean value to indicate that the first consent
 *   category cannot be unchecked.
 * - privacy_settings_tab_label: Label text for the Privacy settings tab.
 * - withdraw_button_on_info_popup: Show the withdraw button on this popup.
 * - method: Chosen consent method.
