Robinson, , has written up her Service Design in Government Keynote. Here, she shares her journey as a designer (for context), the need to be intentional about the role you play in change, and organising social imagination.*\n\n\"I invite you to imagine that a cascade of change was unleashed, some triggered by crises like the Covid-19 Pandemic that reset our patterns of work, travel and showed us how much communities can come together. Other change has been triggered by the School Strikes for Climate, the Sunrise Movement and other local but connected projects and movements across the globe, so that a momentum has built thats became unstoppable. The pressure for this positive change has come from business, from local government, from communities, from schools and universities. A hunger for a new culture has built and spread rapidly after a few global crisis that jolted us into the collaborative action we needed.\"","id":"5e9db6d689d3bf7774433272","name":"Social Dreaming -

Business Review article by Michaela J. Kerrissey and Amy C. Edmondson offering 4 lessons for leaders in crisis.*\n\n\"Fiascos ranging from NASA’s Columbia Shuttle disaster in 2003 to the 2008 financial system collapse have brought into sharp relief the unique challenge that ambiguous threats pose to leaders: cognitive biases, dysfunctional group dynamics, and organizational pressures push them toward discounting the risk and delaying action, often to catastrophic ends.\"\n\n\"It takes a unique kind of leadership to push against the natural human tendency to downplay and delay. Far too many leaders instead try to send upbeat messages assuring all is well — which, in the current tragedy, has unfortunately led to unnecessary lost life at a scale that may never be accurately counted.\" \n\n\"Leadership in an uncertain, fast-moving crisis means making oneself available to feel what it is like to be in another’s shoes — to lead with empathy. Perhaps in the coming weeks the unfortunate scale of this pandemic will make empathy easier for many leaders. But awful scale can also have a numbing effect. It will be incumbent on leaders to put themselves in another’s suffering, to feel with empathy and think with intelligence, and then to use their position of authority to make a path forward for us all. Crises of historical proportion can make for leaders of historical distinction, but that is far from guaranteed.\"","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5e98776da2764d4f65d347c7","idLabels":["5e98776d7669b22549a7e8cf"],"idList":"5e98958a540d112435ac41a5","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":3,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"What
