Kerrissey and Amy C. Edmondson offering 4 lessons for leaders in crisis.*\n\n\"Fiascos ranging from NASA’s Columbia Shuttle disaster in 2003 to the 2008 financial system collapse have brought into sharp relief the unique challenge that ambiguous threats pose to leaders: cognitive biases, dysfunctional group dynamics, and organizational pressures push them toward discounting the risk and delaying action, often to catastrophic ends.\"\n\n\"It takes a unique kind of leadership to push against the natural human tendency to downplay and delay. Far too many leaders instead try to send upbeat messages assuring all is well — which, in the current tragedy, has unfortunately led to unnecessary lost life at a scale that may never be accurately counted.\" \n\n\"Leadership in an uncertain, fast-moving crisis means making oneself available to feel what it is like to be in another’s shoes — to lead with empathy. Perhaps in the coming weeks the unfortunate scale of this pandemic will make empathy easier for many leaders. But awful scale can also have a numbing effect. It will be incumbent on leaders to put themselves in another’s suffering, to feel with empathy and think with intelligence, and then to use their position of authority to make a path forward for us all. Crises of historical proportion can make for leaders of historical distinction, but that is far from guaranteed.\""},"card":{"desc":"","id":"5e9d95bd89965867fe876b31","name":"What good leadership looks like during this pandemic","idShort":3,"shortLink":"9gkKrTb1"},"board":{"id":"5e98776da2764d4f65d347c7","name":"National Leadership Centre COVID-19 Library","shortLink":"X1OQEy5Q"},"list":{"id":"5e98958a540d112435ac41a5","name":"Crisis Leadership"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-05-05T14:12:34.219Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","username":"nuriaruiz","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704/bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","fullName":"Núria Ruiz","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"NR","nonPublic":{},"nonPublicAvailable":true}},{"id":"5eb17367a7e5e56d6c143f2a","idMemberCreator":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","data":{"old":{"desc":"Brenton Caffin, Executive Director of States of Change, writes about how being confused is OK, and so is daring to imagine a better world."},"card":{"desc":"Brenton Caffin, Executive Director of States of Change, writes about how being confused is OK - and so is daring to imagine a better world.","id":"5eaaa3703f5d786380d77ea3","name":"On discombobulation","idShort":36,"shortLink":"fR3aUGJs"},"board":{"id":"5e98776da2764d4f65d347c7","name":"National Leadership Centre COVID-19 Library","shortLink":"X1OQEy5Q"},"list":{"id":"5e98955d5ba03120a21097a7","name":"Wellbeing"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-05-05T14:08:39.206Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","username":"nuriaruiz","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704/bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","fullName":"Núria Ruiz","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"NR","nonPublic":{},"nonPublicAvailable":true}},{"id":"5eb1725eaeaf0a6540fa4708","idMemberCreator":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","data":{"old":{"desc":"Pavitra Raja (Community Specialist, Social Entrepreneurs - Europe and the Americas, World Economic Forum) spoke with leading social innovators who are experts in the field of mental health and healthcare to garner their insights."},"card":{"desc":"Learn how to handle stress and help others in this round up from the World Economic Forum, bringing together leading social innovators and experts in the field of mental health and healthcare.","id":"5eac195bb4af7e55bea9c71f","name":"Experts explain how to manage mental wellbeing during Covid-19","idShort":41,"shortLink":"G8p74Wfn"},"board":{"id":"5e98776da2764d4f65d347c7","name":"National Leadership Centre COVID-19 Library","shortLink":"X1OQEy5Q"},"list":{"id":"5e98955d5ba03120a21097a7","name":"Wellbeing"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-05-05T14:04:14.872Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","username":"nuriaruiz","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704/bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","fullName":"Núria Ruiz","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"NR","nonPublic":{},"nonPublicAvailable":true}},{"id":"5eb1718cb7978a46e18c9132","idMemberCreator":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","data":{"old":{"name":"Experts explain how to manage mental wellbeing during COVID-19"},"card":{"name":"Experts explain how to manage mental wellbeing during Covid-19","id":"5eac195bb4af7e55bea9c71f","idShort":41,"shortLink":"G8p74Wfn"},"board":{"id":"5e98776da2764d4f65d347c7","name":"National Leadership Centre COVID-19 Library","shortLink":"X1OQEy5Q"},"list":{"id":"5e98955d5ba03120a21097a7","name":"Wellbeing"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-05-05T14:00:44.885Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","username":"nuriaruiz","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704/bf9e36fc2f13448016320ca75eb40526","fullName":"Núria Ruiz","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"NR","nonPublic":{},"nonPublicAvailable":true}},{"id":"5eb17156d859d51559a0293c","idMemberCreator":"54eb51ffc17ac79c7d0e0704","data":{"old":{"desc":"How can we take care of our mental health while facing the uncertainty of the Covid-19 crisis?\n\nThree Oxford Saïd academics with expertise in the science of wellbeing will offer practical advice based on their research into what makes us happier, how to protect mental health at work and how social media can help our psychological wellbeing."},"card":{"desc":"How can we take care of our mental health while facing the uncertainty of the Covid-19 crisis?

Far too many leaders instead try to send upbeat messages assuring all is well — which, in the current tragedy, has unfortunately led to unnecessary lost life at a scale that may never be accurately counted.\" \n\n\"Leadership in an uncertain, fast-moving crisis means making oneself available to feel what it is like to be in another’s shoes — to lead with empathy. Perhaps in the coming weeks the unfortunate scale of this pandemic will make empathy easier for many leaders. But awful scale can also have a numbing effect. It will be incumbent on leaders to put themselves in another’s suffering, to feel with empathy and think with intelligence, and then to use their position of authority to make a path forward for us all.
